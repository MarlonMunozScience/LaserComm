# How to calculate Poisson Probability from spreadsheet

From the master noise data sheet, we are given the frequency of noise is different units. If we can assume that the receiver is diffraction limited, then we are given the noise in the units of $\frac{photons}{seconds  * microns} $

Given the slot time and a chosen wavelength to transmit the photons, we can easily calculate the expected photons for each noise source.

$$ E(X) = \lambda = Noise * s * \mu m $$
